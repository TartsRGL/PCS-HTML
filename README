# PCS-HTML

Welcome to my **HTML dojo**.
This repo lays the groundwork for everything that follows — before CSS, before layout tricks, before polish.
It’s not just about writing markup. It’s about **deciding** what the markup means.

## 📚 About the Project

**PCS-HTML** is a structured, calm journey through **HTML decision-making**:

* From basic skeletons to real‑world page composition
* From semantics to structure and order
* From “what tag” to “why this belongs here”

Each lesson builds on the last.
It’s not a reference guide — it’s a trajectory.

## 🗂️ Lessons Overview

| Lesson | Focus                 | Highlights                   |
| ------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| L1     | Skeleton & Semantics  | doctype, main landmarks      |
| L2     | Content Hierarchy     | headings, article vs section |
| L3     | Layout Containers     | wrappers, structure for CSS  |
| L4     | Flow & Order          | DOM order vs visual order    |
| L5     | Positioning Prep      | parents, layers, stacking    |
| L6     | Components            | reusable, BEM‑ready HTML     |
| L7     | Forms & Accessibility | labels, fieldsets, errors    |
| L8     | Composition           | real‑world HTML compromises  |

## 🛠️ Method

* **Language:** HTML
* **Approach:** Content‑first, semantic, accessible
* **Rule:** One lesson = one growing HTML file (C1–C8)

Nothing is rewritten.
Everything is built progressively.

## 🚀 How to Explore

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TartsRGL/PCS-HTML.git

   ```
2. Navigate to a lesson:

   ```bash
   cd "PCS-HTML/L1_html_skeleton_semantics"

   ```
3. Open `index.html` and read it like a story.

## 🔮 Coming After / Maybe Next

* **PCS-CSS** — CSS reacting to correct HTML decisions
* **PCS-JS** *(maybe)* — behaviour, state, interaction, logic

## 🧠 Why PCS-HTML?

Because most CSS problems start with the wrong HTML decision.
This repo trains that decision‑making muscle.
