# 🧱 PCS-HTML

Welcome to my **HTML dojo**.
This repo lays the groundwork for everything that follows – before CSS, before layout tricks, before polish.
It’s not just about writing markup. It’s about **deciding** what the markup means.

## 📚 About the Project

**PCS-HTML** is a structured, calm journey through **HTML decision‑making**:

* From basic skeletons to real‑world page composition
* From semantics to structure and order
* From "what tag" to "why this belongs here"

Each lesson builds on the last.
It’s not a reference guide – it’s a trajectory.

## 🗂️ Lessons Overview

| Lesson | Focus                | Highlights                   |
| ------ | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| L1     | Skeleton & Semantics | doctype, main landmarks      |
| L2     | Content Hierarchy    | headings, article vs section |
| L3     | Layout Containers    | wrappers, structure for CSS  |
| L4     | Flow & Order         | DOM order vs visual order    |
| L5     | Positioning Prep     | parents, layers, stacking    |
| L6     | Components           | reusable, BEM‑ready HTML     |
| L7     | Forms & A11y         | labels, fieldsets, errors    |
| L8     | Composition          | real‑world HTML compromises  |

## 🛠️ Method

* **Language:** HTML (no styling focus)
* **Approach:** Content‑first, semantic, accessible
* **Rule:** One lesson = one growing HTML file (C1–C8)

Nothing is rewritten.
Everything is built progressively.

🔮 Coming After

* **PCS-CSS** – CSS reacting to correct HTML decisions
PCS-JS (maybe) – the final step of the frontend journey
Behaviour, state, interaction, and logic on top of solid HTML + CSS

🧠 Why PCS-HTML?
Because most CSS problems start with the wrong HTML decision.
This repo trains that decision‑making muscle.
