# Lesson 2 – Content Structure & Hierarchy

This folder contains the **HTML-only code** for Lesson 2 of the **PCS-HTML** series.

It focuses on building a **correct content hierarchy** before any CSS or layout decisions are made.

It demonstrates:

- Multiple `article` elements inside one `main`
- Strict heading discipline (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`)
- When to use `section`
- Why `section` requires a heading
- Separation of intro content from structured blocks
- Proper use of `aside` as complementary content
- Structural validation without layout thinking

Each commit introduces **one clear HTML decision at a time** – step-by-step.
